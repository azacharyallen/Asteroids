Asteroids
=========

An interpretation of the classic game written in JavaScript / HTML5 Canvas.

### Features
* Rotatable ship with the ability to thrust in any direction.  Ship maintains velocity.
* Asteroids with collision detection that "bounce" off each other, reflecting off their summed vectors and maintaining total momentum.
